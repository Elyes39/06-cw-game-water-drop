# Water Quest

Water Quest is a small browser game that promotes charity: water’s mission of providing clean water. Click or tap yellow jerry cans to earn points and avoid pollutants. The game lasts 30 seconds and supports mouse and touch input.

How to play

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click **Start Game**.
3. Click or tap yellow jerry cans to earn +10 points.
4. Avoid pollutants (oil barrels). Tapping a pollutant deducts -5 points and may subtract 2 seconds.
5. When the timer reaches 0, the final score is shown. Click **Play Again** to restart.

Files of interest

- `index.html` — markup for start screen, HUD, game area and end screen.
- `styles.css` — layout, colors and animations following charity: water's yellow and light-blue theme.
- `script.js` — game logic: spawning, input, scoring, timer, feedback, and restart.
- `img/` — contains `cw_logo.png`, `water-can.png`, and optional sound files can be added.

Notes

- Optional sound files: place `splash.mp3` and `buzz.mp3` inside `img/` to enable audio feedback.
- The project is intentionally simple and well-commented for learning and extension.

Enjoy! Every drop counts.
